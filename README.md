# Java-Project
The Hospital Management System is a comprehensive core Java project that facilitates the effective management of various administrative and clinical operations within a hospital or healthcare facility. The system is designed to streamline processes, enhance efficiency, and improve patient care. Key features include patient management, appointment scheduling, doctor and staff management, billing and insurance management, pharmacy and inventory management, laboratory and test management, and reporting and analytics. By automating tasks and centralizing information, the system optimizes workflow, reduces errors, and ultimately enhances the overall performance of the hospital.
